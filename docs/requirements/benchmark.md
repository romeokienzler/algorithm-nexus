# Requirements for models benchmarking

The primary objective of this document is to establish the core requirements for
a flexible, robust, and user-friendly benchmarking system for the Algorithm
Nexus project. This system evaluates registered models, supports internal and
external benchmarks, and allows users to easily discover available testing
options.

To ensure clarity, these requirements are divided into two categories: Generic
System Requirements (applying to the framework, interfaces, and general
execution) and Administrator Environment & Process Requirements (applying
specifically to the central execution infrastructure managed by the project
admins).

## Terminology

To establish a clear mental model, the relationship between core components can
be summarized as: Benchmark Instance = Benchmark Target + Benchmark (Workload +
Benchmark Experiment)

- **Workload** The problem or task an AI model or algorithm is intended to
  solve, including the associated inputs, data, and execution pattern exercised
  by the benchmark driver.

- **Benchmark Target** The AI model or algorithm being evaluated. This is the
  element that varies across benchmark experiments while the benchmark
  definition and workload specification are held constant.

- **Benchmark Experiment** A script, harness, or workflow that executes the
  benchmark target on the workload, controlling execution conditions, and
  collects measurements. The experiment will take benchmark target as input. The
  benchmark experiment may hard-code the workload (**fixed**) OR the workload is
  specified by passing certain values for the benchmark experiments parameters
  (**parameterizable**)

- **Benchmark** A standardized, repeatable evaluation used to compare the
  behavior of a benchmark target (versions of AI models or algorithms) on a
  problem of interest (workload) under controlled conditions. Embodied as either
  a **fixed benchmark experiment** or a **workload** plus **parameterized
  benchmark experiment**.

- **Benchmark Result** The quantitative measurements produced by executing a
  benchmark experiment (e.g., accuracy, runtime, throughput, resource
  utilization), with the **workload** - used to compare benchmark targets.

- **Benchmark Instance** A concrete execution of a benchmark, in which a
  benchmark driver runs a workload against a specific benchmark target and
  records measurements.

## Part I: Generic Benchmarking System Requirements

### REQ-1: Standardized Benchmark Packaging Protocol

This section sets requirements for how benchmark experiments are constructed,
formatted, standardized, and versioned to ensure reproducibility.

- **REQ 1.1: Input/Output Specification** A benchmark experiment must define its
  inputs and outputs using a standardized system schema. Experiments must accept
  the benchmark target (model or algorithm) as a primary programmatic input, and
  may support additional optional parameters. _Rationale_: Ensures the system
  can uniformly interact with diverse benchmark implementations.

- **REQ 1.2: Python Package** All benchmark experiments, including wrappers for
  external frameworks, must be implemented in Python and distributed as standard
  Python packages. Each package must define all its runtime dependencies.
  _Rationale_: Provides a predictable, unified installation mechanism for
  automated pipelines.

- **REQ 1.3: Versioning** Benchmark experiments are responsible for their own
  versioning. The system’s specification method must be flexible enough to
  satisfy differing versioning approaches across packages.

- **REQ 1.4: Reproducible Execution** Benchmark experiments must ensure that the
  combination of their name, version and the specific names and values of all
  their parameters defines a unique, repeatable execution.

- **REQ 1.5: Lifecycle Management** It must be possible to mark a benchmark
  experiment as deprecated. _Rationale_: Prevents technical debt and signals to
  users which benchmarks are no longer actively maintained or relevant.

- **REQ 1.7: Required Data** If a benchmark experiment requires specific data
  files to execute a workload these must be either (a) contained in the python
  package providing the experiment; (b) downloaded by the experiment.
  _Rationale_: Guarantees that automated execution does not fail due to missing
  local filesystem dependencies.

### REQ-2: Benchmark Registration and Discoverability

This section outlines requirements for managing and discovering available
benchmarks and benchmark experiments.

- **REQ 2.1: Benchmark Experiment Registration** The system must provide a
  method for users to add benchmark experiments, implemented according to the
  Standardized Benchmark Packaging Protocol

- **REQ 2.2: Benchmark Experiment Discovery** The system must provide a method
  for users to list the registered benchmark experiments (including deprecated
  experiments). _Rationale_: Encourages reuse and prevents duplicated effort
  across different research teams.

- **REQ 2.3: Benchmark Registration** The system must provide a method to define
  and register a **benchmark**:
- either as
    1. a combination of a parameterizable benchmark experiment and a benchmark
       workload
    2. a fixed benchmark experiment

- **REQ 2.4: Benchmark Discovery** The system must provide a method for user to
  list the registered benchmarks and the models/algorithms using them.
  _Rationale_: Allows package owners to easily compare their models against
  established historical baselines.

---

### REQ-3: Using the Benchmarking System

This section details requirement for package owners to use the benchmarking
system

- **REQ 3.1: Benchmark Specification** To use the system to benchmark a
  model/algorithm, the Nexus package owner must specify the benchmark to use, in
  the manner defined by the system c.f. REQ 2-3.

- **REQ 3.2: Providing Benchmark Experiments** If a model/algorithm requires a
  benchmark experiment not in the registry, the contributor must provide one, in
  compliance with the Standardized Packaging Protocol c.f. REQ-1. _Rationale_:
  Empowers contributors to expand the system's capabilities.

- **REQ 3.3: Benchmark Experiment Reuse** The system must allow referencing and
  utilizing an existing benchmark experiment or benchmark definition across
  Nexus packages.

---

### REQ-4: Execution and Orchestration

This section covers operational requirements for execution, resource handling,
and failure management.

- **REQ 4.1: Single and Sweep Execution** The system must support both executing
  single benchmark instances and parameter sweeps. _Rationale_: Sweeps are
  essential for performance profiling and evaluating models across a spectrum of
  workloads.

- **REQ 4.2: Resource Specification** The system must allow benchmark
  experiments to define the compute resources they require. _Rationale_: Ensures
  the system schedules tasks on capable hardware, preventing Out-Of-Memory (OOM)
  errors and execution bottlenecks.

- **REQ 4.3: Resource Limits** The system must support setting hard limits on
  maximum resource usage (time, compute, memory) per benchmark instance or set
  of instances. _Rationale_: Prevents processes from hogging shared
  infrastructure in the admin environment.

- **REQ 4.4: Result Capture** The system must ensure results from any successful
  benchmark instance are saved.

- **REQ 4.5: Standardized Error Reporting** The system must provide a
  standardized mechanism for reporting known, handled execution errors.

- **REQ 4.6: Logging** The system must capture unexpected execution failures,
  including the underlying Python exception and traceback. Eecution logs must be
  captured and made accessible to the user executing the benchmark. The system
  is not required to retain these logs indefinitely.

- **REQ 4.7: Self-Contained Execution** Benchmark experiments must be
  self-contained and must not rely on pre-existing filesystem data. _Rationale_:
  Ensures seamless portability between local developer machines and remote
  orchestration environments.

- **REQ 4.8: Local Execution** The system must enable benchmark experiments to
  be executed locally by a user with sufficient compute resources. _Rationale_:
  Allows developers to rapidly prototype, test, and debug benchmarks and to
  confirm results of automated benchmarkming runs.

### REQ-5: Data Storage and Analysis

This section outlines how results and supporting context are persisted.

- **REQ 5.1: Centralized Results Storage** Results of all benchmark instances
  must be stored in a centralized location accessible by the respective package
  owners. _Rationale_: Facilitates cross-model comparison, historical tracking,
  and platform-wide reporting.

- **REQ 5.2: Common Results Schema** The system must enforce a common schema and
  metadata standards for all stored benchmark results. _Rationale_: Enables
  automated data analysis, programmatic querying, and integration with
  visualization dashboards.

- **REQ 5.3: Custom Metadata Support** The system must allow benchmark
  experiments to store custom metadata alongside execution results. _Rationale_:
  Ensures nuanced, model/algorithm-specific context is not lost during
  standardized data capture.

---

## Part II: Administrator Environment & Process Requirements

### REQ-6: Admin Execution Environment

This section defines the infrastructure requirements for the centralized
benchmarking environment managed by project administrators.

- **REQ 6.1: Admin Execution** The system must be capable of executing
  benchmarks on administrator infrastructure.

- **REQ 6.2: Isolated Execution** The system must support isolated execution of
  benchmark experiments for dependency management. _Rationale_: Prevents
  dependency cross-contamination and version clashes (especially critical for
  low-level libraries like CUDA and vLLM) between different concurrently running
  models.

- **REQ 6.3: Persistent Filesystem** The admin environment must provide a
  persistent filesystem between executions. _Rationale_: Optimizes performance
  by allowing large datasets to be cached and reused across multiple benchmark
  runs.

---

### REQ-7: Nexus-Level Orchestration & Review

This section defines requirements for cross-package evaluations and
administrative oversight.

- **REQ 7.1: Nexus-Level Benchmarks Definition** The system must support
  defining benchmarks independently of individual Nexus packages.

- **REQ 7.2: Admin-Triggered Evaluation Execution** The system must provide a
  dedicated mechanism for administrators to trigger and execute benchmarks.

- **REQ 7.3: Sweep Review and Approval** The administrative process must include
  a manual or automated review step for submitted sweep configurations prior to
  execution. _Rationale_: Acts as a safeguard against accidental misuse of
  expensive compute resources due to misconfigured parameter sweeps.
