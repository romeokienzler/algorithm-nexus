# Requirements for a Nexus Package

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for defining a Nexus package and the
models it contains. A Nexus package encapsulates a Python package together with
its associated models, providing standardized metadata for validation, testing,
benchmarking, and integration within the Algorithm Nexus ecosystem. When
mentioning model we always refer to a Hugging Face repository hosting the model
documentation and weights.

---

## 2. Core Requirements

### REQ-1: Python Packages Used in Nexus

A Python package **must** fulfill a set of requirements to guarantee it can be
properly integrated with Nexus.

- **REQ-1.1 (Release):** A Python package **must** must provide versioned
  releases, using any versioning scheme as long as it guarantees that increasing
  version numbers represent newer releases. The releases must be published on
  GitHub or PyPI.
- **REQ-1.2 (Owner):** Each Python package **must** define at least one
  maintainer. This will be considered as owner of the Nexus package.
- **REQ-1.3 (Metadata):** Each Python package **must** include a description and
  link to documentation in the released wheel.
- **REQ-1.4 (Dependencies):** Each Python package **must** define all
  dependencies required for use and testing.

### REQ-2: Nexus Package Definition

A Nexus package must allow for the following information to be recorded:

- **REQ-2.1 (Python Package):** A Nexus package **must** provide the PyPI
  package name or GitHub repository name, which serves as the identifier within
  Algorithm Nexus.

- **REQ-2.2 (Python Package Version):** A Nexus package **may** provide the
  version of the python package to be used for dependency resolution.

- **REQ-2.3 (Supported Models):** A Nexus package **must** have a mechanism to
  define the models it supports.

- **REQ-2.4 (Agent skills):** A Nexus package **may** specify agent skills for
  using the python package, either directly embedded in the Nexus package (e.g.
  AGENTS.md) or as a link to existing skills on an external repository.

### REQ-3: Model Definition

Each model contained in a Nexus package allows recording the operational
artifacts required for integration into Algorithm Nexus.

- **REQ-3.1 (Identifier):** The model Hugging Face repository name serves as the
  identifier (for example, `ibm-esa-geospatial/TerraMind-base-Flood`).

- **REQ-3.2 (Testing):** Each model **must** provide the artifacts required for
  testing the model, as defined in
  [Requirements for Model Testing](./models_testing.md).

- **REQ-3.3 (Benchmarking):** Each model **may** provide the artifacts required
  for benchmarking, such as scripts and any model-specific benchmarking
  requirements.

- **REQ-3.4 (Owner):** Each model **must** have a designated owner. By default,
  the owner of the Nexus package will be the the owner of each model unless a
  specific owner is given.

### REQ-4: Artifact Specification

A Nexus package must allow specifying additional, optional, artifacts and
information that support integration with agent frameworks and serving runtimes.

- **REQ-4.1 (Model Usage):** A model **must** have a mechanism to provide usage
  documentation to help users get started.

- **REQ-4.2 (Agent Integration):** A Nexus package **must** have a mechanism to
  provide usage documentation for the integration with one or more supported
  agent frameworks, protocols, or model-tool interaction interfaces.

- **REQ-4.3 (vLLM Integration):** A model **must** have a mechanism to provide
  information related to serving the model with `vllm`, including any
  `vllm`-specific plugins required in the Python environment used for serving.

## 3. Notes

- Benchmarking and testing requirements may be unified in the future, depending
  on the outcomes of issues `#8` and `#18`.
