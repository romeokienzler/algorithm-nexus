# Algorithm Nexus Dependency Resolution Process

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the dependency declaration and dependency resolution
process for **Algorithm Nexus** in the context of the three distribution package
variants defined in
[Requirements for Package Variants and Dependency Management](../requirements/packaging_and_dependency_reqs.md#req1-multiple-build-targets).

It explains how distribution package variants are implemented using the
packaging system, how dependencies are added, and how correctness is enforced
via continuous integration (CI).

## 2. Packaging and Variant-Based Dependency Resolution

Algorithm Nexus uses **uv** as its packaging system and is built as
**`algorithm-nexus`**.

Support for multiple distribution package variants is implemented using
**optional dependencies (extras)** as defined by uv:
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#optional-dependencies>

The mapping between **distribution package variants** and **optional
dependencies** is defined as follows:

- **Ecosystem Variant**
    - Installation target: `algorithm-nexus[ecosystem]`
    - The dependency graph **must not include** the `vllm` library.
    - Only Algorithm Stack packages associated with the _Ecosystem Algorithm
      Stack_ are included.

- **Candidate Variant**
    - Installation target: `algorithm-nexus[candidate]`
    - The dependency graph **must include** the `vllm` library.
    - A **specific version of `vllm` must always be required**.
    - Only Algorithm Stack packages associated with the _Candidate Algorithm
      Stack_ are included.

- **Product Variant**
    - Installation target: `algorithm-nexus[product]`
    - The dependency graph **must include** the `vllm` library.
    - A **specific, pinned version of `vllm` must always be required**.
    - Only Algorithm Stack packages associated with the _Product Algorithm
      Stack_ are included.

Because different variants may result in mutually incompatible dependency
graphs, uv is relied upon to isolate and resolve dependencies per variant.
Conflicts between variants are permitted; **dependency conflicts within a single
variant are not**.

Dependency conflict handling follows uv’s documented behavior:
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#conflicting-dependencies>

## 3. Adding Dependencies to Algorithm Nexus

All Algorithm Stack dependencies **must** be added to Algorithm Nexus using
**uv** and **must** be explicitly associated with one or more distribution
package variants.

Algorithm Nexus does **not** use a default dependency group for Algorithm Stack
packages. Every Algorithm Stack package is associated with variants exclusively
via optional dependencies (extras).

Manual editing of dependency declarations, lockfiles, or exported requirement
files is **strictly forbidden**. All dependency changes **must** be performed
using uv commands only.

Official instructions for adding dependencies are documented in the uv guide:
<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-sources>

## 4. Variant Association Rules

Algorithm Stack packages are classified based on **how they declare `vllm` in
their dependency metadata**, distinguishing between default and optional
dependencies.

When adding an Algorithm Stack package, contributors **must** classify it using
exactly one of the following categories. This will determine the exact process
they have to follow.

### 4.1 Ecosystem‑Only Packages

An **ecosystem‑only package** is a package that:

- does **not** declare `vllm` as a default dependency, and
- does **not** declare `vllm` as an optional dependency.

These packages can never introduce `vllm` into a dependency graph.

**Variant integration rules:**

- These packages **must** be added to the **Ecosystem Variant**.
- They **must not** be added to the Candidate or Product Variants.

### 4.2 vllm‑Dependent Packages

A **vllm‑dependent package** is a package that:

- declares `vllm` as a **default (mandatory) dependency**.

These packages always introduce `vllm` into the dependency graph.

**Variant integration rules:**

- These packages **must** be added to either or both of the **Candidate** and
  **Product** Variants.
- These packages **must not** be added to the Ecosystem Variant.

### 4.3 vllm‑Agnostic Packages

A **vllm‑agnostic package** is a package that:

- does **not** declare `vllm` as a default dependency, but
- declares `vllm` as an **optional dependency** (via one or more extras).

These packages can participate in dependency graphs **both with and without**
`vllm`, depending on how they are installed.

**Variant integration rules:**

- For the **Ecosystem Variant**: the package **must** be added **without
  enabling any extras** that introduce `vllm` into the dependency graph.

- For the **Candidate** and **Product Variants**: the package **must** be added
  **with extras enabled** such that `vllm` is included in the resolved
  dependency graph of the Algorithm Stack package.

## 5. Adding Packages with uv

All Algorithm Stack packages are added using **uv**. The concrete commands are
determined by:

1. the package’s classification (see Section 4), and
2. the distribution package variant being targeted.

The **same package may be added differently for different variants**, depending
on whether `vllm` must or must not be present in the resulting dependency graph.

### 5.1 General Command Pattern

All packages are added using the following pattern:

```bash
uv add <package-spec> --optional <variant-extra>
```

!!! note

    We recommend MacOS users to add the `--no-sync` argument to the the `uv add`
    command, to avoid errors with `uv` not being able to sync the dependencies
    with the local python environment.

Where `<variant-extra>` is one of:

- `ecosystem`
- `candidate`
- `product`

Use the variant association rules defined in
[Section 4](#4-variant-association-rules) to determine what variants the package
should be added to. Packages **must only** be added to the extras required by
their classification.

### 5.2 Ecosystem‑Only Packages

Add the package **only** to the Ecosystem Variant:

```bash
uv add <package-name> --optional ecosystem
```

### 5.3 vllm‑Dependent Packages

!!! note

    Algorithm Stack package developers **must not** add packages to the `product`
    variant. Algorithm Nexus owners will add them once product requirements have
    been met, and will coordinate with the developers in case of need.

Add the package to the vllm‑enabled variants:

```bash
uv add <package-name> --optional candidate
```

### 5.4 vllm‑Agnostic Packages

These packages must be added **differently per variant**.

#### Ecosystem Variant (vllm excluded)

Add the package **without enabling any extras** that introduce `vllm`:

```bash
uv add <package-name> --optional ecosystem
```

or, if the package requires a specific non‑vllm extra:

```bash
uv add <package-name>[<non-vllm-extra>] --optional ecosystem
```

#### Candidate and Product Variants (vllm included)

!!! note

    Algorithm Stack package developers **must not** add packages to the `product`
    variant. Algorithm Nexus owners will add them once product requirements have
    been met, and will coordinate with the developers in case of need.

Add the package **with extras enabled** such that `vllm` is included in the
dependency graph:

```bash
uv add <package-name>[<vllm-extra>] --optional candidate
```

or, if the package also requires non‑vllm extras:

```bash
uv add <package-name>[<vllm-extra>,<non-vllm-extra>] --optional candidate
```

### 5.5 Git‑Based Packages

!!! warning

    SSH-based cloning is not supported. All Git dependencies **must** be publicly
    accessible and clonable via HTTPS.

For packages hosted in a public Git repository, the same rules apply.

General form:

```bash
uv add git+https://<git-server-url>/<org>/<repository>[<extras>] --optional <variant-extra>
```

Repeat the command for each variant as required by
[Section 4](#4-variant-association-rules), enabling or disabling
dependency‑introducing extras as appropriate.

## 6. Dependency Resolution Checks in CI

The Algorithm Nexus CI pipeline **must** enforce dependency correctness checks
on every pull request. Each of the commands that follow is required to exit with
code `0`.

### 6.1 Lockfile and Export Consistency

#### 6.1.1 `uv.lock` Presence and Freshness

CI **must** verify that a `uv.lock` file exists and is up to date with respect
to the project's dependency declarations.

```shell
uv lock --check
```

#### 6.1.2 Variant-Specific Requirements Exports

CI **must** verify that for each distribution package variant (`ecosystem`,
`candidate`, `product`), a variant-specific requirements file (called
`requirements-<variant-extra>.txt`) has been exported from `uv.lock` and is up
to date.

```bash
for variant in ecosystem candidate product; do
    stat "requirements-${variant}.txt"
    uv export -q --frozen --no-emit-project \
              --no-header --no-default-groups \
              --extra "${variant}" --output-file="requirements-${variant}-ci.txt"
    diff "requirements-${variant}.txt" "requirements-${variant}-ci.txt"
done
```

#### 6.1.3 Package Availability and Validity

CI **must** verify that all packages listed in each
`requirements-<variant-extra>.txt` file are resolvable and installable from the
configured package index for the linux platform.

```shell
for variant in ecosystem candidate product; do
    uv pip install -r "requirements-${variant}.txt" --reinstall --dry-run --python-platform linux
done
```

### 6.2 Variant Dependency Resolution Checks

#### Ecosystem Variant

CI **must** verify that resolving the `ecosystem` extra **does not** produce a
dependency graph that contains `vllm`.

```shell
! grep vllm requirements-ecosystem.txt
```
