# Algorithm Nexus Benchmarking System

## Executive Summary

This document proposes a benchmarking system for the Algorithm Stack packages
within Algorithm Nexus based on
[the benchmarking requirements](../requirements/benchmark.md).

An analysis of the benchmarking requirements indicates that `ado` natively
fulfills the majority of the complex orchestration, data provenance, and
scalable execution needs for evaluating **benchmark targets** against defined
**workloads**. By combining `ado` and Ray with specific **Algorithm Nexus
Extensions**, integration definitions, and robust administrative processes, the
team can deliver a comprehensive, end-to-end benchmarking solution capable of
generating repeatable **benchmark results**.

To fully satisfy these requirements, the design of the Benchmarking System is
divided into three **Architectural Pillars**: System Architecture (The
Mechanisms), Operational Architecture (The Infrastructure), and Governance &
Conventions (The Standards).

---

## 1. System Architecture (The Mechanisms)

This pillar details the technical components, automated mechanisms, and
execution engines that make up the benchmarking system.

### 1.1 Two-Tiered Packaging Architecture

The system utilizes a two-tiered architecture to strictly separate the
definition of a benchmark experiment from its application to a specific AI
model.

| Tier                                        | Component       | Responsibility & Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tier 1: Benchmark Experiment Definition** | `ado` core      | Serves as the core capability engine. It provides the framework to define, package, and execute a self-contained benchmark experiment. It enforces strict input/output interfaces, handles versioning of the experiment logic, and manages the execution provenance independently of the target model. |
| **Tier 2: Benchmark Integration**           | `nexus` Package | While `ado` knows _how_ to run an experiment, `nexus` dictates _when_ and _against what_. It provides the declarative metadata required to define a benchmark: bind a specific target (the model) to a specific `ado` benchmark experiment and a defined workload.                                     |

### 1.2 Event & Orchestration Broker

**GitHub** acts as the primary interface and event broker for the system. It
captures user intent and system state changes (e.g., deployments or releases),
routing these events to the underlying execution infrastructure. It acts as the
technical bridge between human operations and the execution engine.

### 1.3 Execution and Orchestration Engine

The execution architecture relies on **Ray** and **`ado`**. `ado` leverages
**Ray** to handle parameter sweeps and single benchmark instances mechanically.
Thanks to `ado`'s data recording capabilities, if one instance in a sweep fails
`ado` continues orchestration and commits successful results to the database.
Ray allows the underlying experiments to explicitly request hardware resources
(e.g., `@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)`) via task decorators. Ray can also create
per-task execution environments, allowing tests with incompatible requirements
to ado-core or other experiments to execute.

### 1.4 Centralized Data & Discovery

The architecture utilizes `ado` distributed projects capabilities to store data,
enforcing a uniform schema for results and custom metadata dictionaries.
Furthermore, `ado` automatically registers available experiments upon
environment installation, providing built-in commands to list and discover them.

## 2. Operational Architecture (Workflows & Infrastructure)

This pillar details how the system is deployed, maintained, triggered, and
scaled by the administrative team and CI/CD pipelines.

### 2.1 Infrastructure Configuration

Admins configure the **Ray cluster** on K8s via KubeRay, with hard namespace
limits to maintain resource quotas during massive sweeps. To optimize
performance, the underlying cluster mounts a shared persistent filesystem (via
PVC) for workload dataset caching. Ray dynamically isolates worker node
environments to prevent dependency version clashes between concurrent
evaluations.

### 2.2 Orchestration Triggers & Automation

The mechanism for triggering centralized administrative evaluations is fully
automated via **GitHub**. These are triggered mechanically via automated GitHub
events (such as code deployments or releases) or on-demand utilizing GitHub
ChatOps. They are executed with a combination of GitHub Actions (on Event or on
schedule) and polling Runners. Global orchestration across multiple packages
utilizes `ado`'s native search space semantics.

## 3. Governance & Conventions (Policies & Standards)

This pillar outlines the human-in-the-loop requirements, conventions, and
security policies that contributors must adhere to in order for the technical
and operational systems to function correctly.

### 3.1 Trust and Security Model

Nexus relies on an organizational trust model. Only authorized IBMers can submit
code. To enforce security, all packages undergo mandatory standard CI/CD CVE
scans before they are allowed into the execution environment.

### 3.2 Packaging and Versioning Conventions

While `ado` provides the mechanism for versioning and reproducibility,
contributors are bound by strict conventions to ensure uniqueness and
reliability.

- **Reproducibility Contract:** Contributors must adhere to the convention that
  an experiment name plus specific parameter values defines a unique, repeatable
  execution. Repeatable here means **the experiment instance use an identical
  process** not produces the same result, as experiments can be stochastic.
- **Versioning**: ado provides mechanisms for experiment versioning but does not
  prescribe any. The main convention w.r.t experiment versioning is that
  whatever mechanism is chosen ensures the **Reproducibility Contract**
- **Data Handling Guidelines:** Workload data must either be bundled directly
  inside the benchmark experiment package or programmed to download dynamically
  at execution time.

### 3.3 Governance of Sweeps

Because parameter sweeps are computationally expensive, they must undergo
particular scrutiny, with admins retaining manual and automated review
oversight. Sweep configurations must pass GitHub PR approvals prior to being
submitted to the Ray cluster for execution.

## Open Questions

The following questions/decisions are open and can be resolved in subsequent
issues.

- Versioning Semantics for REQ 1.3
    - Rules and conventions for versioning benchmark experiments
- Nexus Test Dependencies Handling for REQ 2.2
    - The process for validating that the benchmark packages referenced by a
      nexus package can be installed together
- Nexus Model Benchmark Specification Decision for REQ 2.3
    - Exact YAML metadata and directory structure used to add a Nexus Model
      benchmark specification
- Nexus Repo Layout for REQ 7.1
    - Exact YAML metadata and directory structure used to add a Nexus benchmark
      specification

## How Nexus package developers will use the system

### Contributing a benchmark experiment

Developers write and package the experiment according to the standardized
packaging protocol (REQ 3.2) i.e. as an ado custom experiment or
actuator+experiments. They put the package on GitHub, PyPI or in the algorithm
nexus repo (REQ 3.2).

### Defining the benchmark experiment packages used by a nexus package

Nexus package owners register the benchmark experiment packages, and the
experiments they want to use, by referencing them in their nexus package's
metadata (REQ 2.1) and validating that all the benchmark experiments the package
needs can be installed together.

### Defining a benchmark to use for a model

First developers can:

- use `nexus` CLI and `ado` CLI to discover existing benchmark experiments (REQ
  2.2)
- use `nexus` CLI to discover existing benchmark specifications (REQ 2.4)

They then define their benchmark using an ado configuration (REQ 3.1) adding
this to the model directory of the relevant nexus package (REQ 2.3). The
benchmark configuration can reference any benchmark experiment registered by the
Nexus package. If the benchmark experiment they need is not registered by the
nexus package
[they can add it.](#defining-the-benchmark-experiment-packages-used-by-a-nexus-package).
The benchmark configuration can also be based on one discovered via the Nexus
CLI.
